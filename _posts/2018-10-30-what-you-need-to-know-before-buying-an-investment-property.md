The rules for purchasing a rental property are highly specific, so anyone considering doing so should be aware of a few key stipulations.

First, realize that you will need a 20% minimum down payment. That said, the higher your down payment on an investment property is, the better—as is the case for other home purchases, as well.

**The interest rate on an investment property will always be at least 0.5% to 0.75% higher than it would be for the purchase of a primary residence,** but submitting a higher down payment can help reduce this cost.

Additionally, your debt-to-income ratio must be below 50%, and you will need to have a sum equivalent to at least six months’ worth of mortgage payments for your primary residence reserved in your bank. In the case of a $1,500 payment, this means you’ll need at least $9,000 in savings, a money market account, an investment account, or some other form of liquid account.

Retirement accounts can also count toward this, but only 60% of the funds within such accounts will be considered—given that retirement accounts tend to hold a penalty associated with liquidation.

And **if you have more than one investment property, you’ll need to multiply this reserve amount by however many properties you accrue.**

Finally, don’t forget that you’ll need to budget for closing costs—that is, unless you can negotiate for the seller to pay them.

The rental market is very strong right now, so I highly encourage anyone able to meet the stipulations we’ve discussed today to pursue building wealth through real estate.
